# Crystal Builder — delivery plan for the TODO

[docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) is the architecture and the roadmap that got
the application built; [docs/TODO.md](TODO.md) is everything that came
out of using it and has never been scheduled.  This file schedules it:
what order, what each phase delivers, and what it is allowed to touch.

Every phase ends with something runnable and a green suite, which is
the same rule [docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) § 16 works to.  Sizes are orders
of magnitude, not estimates: **S** is a day or less, **M** a few days,
**L** a week or more.

A phase ships and its entries are deleted from
[docs/TODO.md](TODO.md); a phase that has shipped is deleted from here.
What follows is everything still owed.

## 1. The order

The interface stretch, planned 2026-09-13: one phase per session, in
this order, because each one changes what the next one photographs,
names or links to.  Phases 1 and 2 change what is on screen and what it
is called; phase 3 anchors help to those names, and phase 4 writes and
photographs them.  The full plan, with its measurements, is
`~/.claude/plans/interface-stretch.md`; the sections below are enough to
start a phase from its name.

| Phase | Delivers | Main files | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 2 — Text pass** | Every visible string in the user's own words, missing tips and help first | `.claude/skills/ui-text/uitext.py`, then the app a window at a time | M |
| **Phase 3 — Help is the manual** | A "?" on every panel and dialog opening the manual at its anchor; the manual's skeleton and generated reference | `xtalapp/help_links.py`, `.claude/skills/manual-writing/reference.py`, `packaging/bundle.py` | M |
| **Phase 4 — User manual** | The manual, one chapter (or page group) per session, M0-M11 | `docs/manual/` | L |

Phase 1 (Styles, Preferences and the chooser) shipped on 2026-09-14;
`git log -- docs/ROADMAP.md` has what it delivered.  **Before each
phase**: commit or stash what the last session left uncommitted, so
each phase's diff is only its own.

Every phase runs targeted test files while iterating and the full suite
once, in the background, with `sysctl vm.swapusage` looked at first.

---

## Phase 2 — Text pass

The user rewrites the text; this phase is the plumbing either side.
**No string is reworded by us.**  Phase 1 has landed, so its new
strings -- the Style groups, the Engines page, the chooser -- are in
the sheet.

1. ~~Missing text gets rows~~ -- done 2026-09-14 (c90c6ea).  The
   sheet has **33** `tip= (missing)` and **17** `help= (missing)`
   rows at the top: the 12 module settings planned, plus five engine
   options (xTB and DFTB+ charge and iteration limits), which
   `reference.py` now counts too.  `where` names them as
   `key (label)` or `TABLE.param (label)`, not `module.action.param`,
   because extract never imports.
2. ~~Hand over the sheet~~ -- `build/ui-text-2026-09.csv`, 1316 rows,
   given to the user 2026-09-14 with the batch order: missing tips and
   help; menus and toolbar; Preferences; Style; chooser; each dock;
   dialogs; module and engine settings; status and error sentences.
   **Waiting on the user's first batch.**
3. **Apply each batch as it comes back**: `--dry-run`, apply, fix the
   tests that quote old wording in the same commit, grab the windows
   touched and report anything clipped or newly scrolling, commit as
   *Reword the <window>*, re-extract.
4. **Close**: `reference.py` reports 0 commands and 0 settings
   missing; `docs/MENUS.md`
   updated; full suite once.

Registry keys and `Param` names never change: phase 3's anchors are
built from them.

## Phase 3 — Help is the manual

The help a "?" opens is the manual's own content, never a second copy.
Decided with the user: the **Sphinx HTML is built into the bundle and
opened in the system browser** at the anchor; a panel's "?" is a
**small flat button at the top right of its contents**, plus F1;
dialogs get `QDialogButtonBox.Help`.

1. **Skeleton.**  Ask before `pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex furo`
   (Sphinx 8.2.3 and MyST 5.1.0 are present).  `docs/manual/conf.py`,
   `index.md`, stubs for the agreed outline, empty `references.bib`,
   the generated `reference/`; `sphinx-build -W` clean.
2. **One list of topics.**  `xtalapp/help_links.py` `TOPICS` maps
   every dock (`panel-<attr>`), every dialog with a Help button
   (`dlg-<key>`, including Preferences pages) and every module action
   (`mod-...`) to its anchor.  `reference.py` reads it and writes
   `reference/dialogs.md`, so an anchor the app opens is one the
   generator wrote.
3. **Opening it.**  `open_help(parent, anchor)` finds the built manual
   (`_internal/docs/manual/html` in a bundle, `build/manual/html` in a
   checkout), maps the anchor to its page through
   `reference/inventory.json`, and opens `file://...#anchor`.  With no
   built manual it opens `HelpWindow` and scrolls to the same anchor,
   which its generated pages now carry, plus a Panels tab.
4. **Buttons.**  `docks.help_corner(dock, anchor)` is an overlay that
   adds nothing to any minimum; dialogs connect `helpRequested`; a
   registry action `help_on_panel` on F1.  `bundle.py` requires the
   built manual and ships it.
- Tests (`tests/test_help_links.py`): `test_every_dock_has_a_help_topic`,
  `test_every_help_topic_is_an_anchor_the_reference_wrote`,
  `test_help_opens_the_built_manual_at_the_anchor`,
  `test_without_a_built_manual_help_scrolls_the_generated_window_there`,
  `test_the_help_corner_adds_nothing_to_a_panel_s_minimum`,
  `test_f1_opens_help_for_the_panel_with_focus`,
  `test_a_dialog_s_help_button_opens_its_own_topic`;
  `test_the_generated_help_carries_the_manual_s_anchors`
  (`test_help_ui.py`); `test_a_bundle_carries_the_built_manual`
  (`test_packaging.py`).
- Docs: CLAUDE.md gains the invariant *help is the manual*
  (`TOPICS` is the one list, anchors are registry keys); the
  manual-writing, add-action and add-module skills say a new panel or
  dialog needs a topic; `PACKAGING.md` says the manual is built first.

---

## Phase 4 — User manual

Written with the `manual-writing` skill, which holds the outline, the
layout, the screenshot script and the style.  One session each; a
top-level chapter too large for one session is split by page.
Installed first: phase 3's toolchain.  TeX is at `/Library/TeX/texbin`
(check `latexmk` in M0).  `ase`, `rdkit`, `rdeditor`, `mace` and
`matplotlib` import; DFTB+ 24.1 and tblite are on PATH; **xTB is not**,
so ask in M6 whether GFN-FF gets figures.

| Session | Delivers |
|---|---|
| M0 | `tutorial_check.py` proving the MIL-88b build (acs, N134, drawn `*c1ccc(*)cc1`; UFF4MOF, relax cell, Smart; P6₃/mmc; acs, then ssa) and the `shots.py` skeleton.  No prose; a wrong answer stops the session. |
| M1 | Quickstart ▸ Your first crystal build |
| M2 | Quickstart ▸ About, Installation, The GUI |
| M3 | Essentials ▸ File, Edit, Select |
| M4 | Essentials ▸ Structure, Symmetry, Cell |
| M5 | Essentials ▸ Measure, View, Window, mouse modes, shortcuts |
| M6 | Modules ▸ Force field (UFF/UFF4MOF, xTB, MACE) |
| M7 | Modules ▸ Zeo++, PXRD |
| M8 | Modules ▸ MOF builder, Molecule builder, Net builder |
| M9 | Modules ▸ Blender export; Quickstart ▸ Recommendations, Troubleshooting |
| M10 | Front matter, Glossary, Bibliography, Index, PDF |
| M11 | Modules ▸ DFTB+ -- only after the postponed DFTB+ phase (§ 2) |

Each session regenerates the reference, builds with `-W` clean, and
reports its word count and open `TODO-cite`s.

## 2. What this plan does not do

* It does not touch the design principles in
  [docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) § 1.  Every phase keeps the core Qt-free,
  keeps every mutation a command, and adds capability through
  registries.
* It does not schedule volumetric data, SHELX round-trips or Rietveld.
  Those are [docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) § 12 and stay there until they are
  asked for.
* It postpones **DFTB+ — split, then merge**; it is not dropped.  The
  manual's DFTB+ chapter (M11) waits for it, because writing it first
  would photograph panels that phase changes.
* It does not try dragging a panel with a real mouse
  ([docs/TODO.md](TODO.md) § Interface); that needs a person's pointer.
  Phase 3 leaves every dock title bar as Qt draws it, so as not to make
  it worse.
