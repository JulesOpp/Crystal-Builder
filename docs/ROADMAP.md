# Crystal Builder — delivery plan for the TODO

[docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) is the architecture and the roadmap that got
the application built; [docs/TODO.md](TODO.md) is everything that came
out of using it and has never been scheduled.  This file schedules it:
what order, what each phase delivers, and what it is allowed to touch.

Every phase ends with something runnable and a green suite, which is
the same rule [docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) § 16 works to.  Sizes are orders
of magnitude, not estimates: **S** is a day or less, **M** a few days,
**L** a week or more.

A phase ships and its entries are deleted from
[docs/TODO.md](TODO.md); a phase that has shipped is deleted from here.
What follows is everything still owed.

---

## 1. The order

Nothing is scheduled.  Every phase the last plan set out has shipped
and been cleared from this file; `git log -- docs/ROADMAP.md` has what
each one delivered.

The next phase is chosen from [docs/TODO.md](TODO.md) by the same
argument the last ones were: **wrong before missing, and small before
large**.

---

## 2. What this plan does not do

* It does not touch the design principles in
  [docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) § 1.  Every phase keeps the core Qt-free,
  keeps every mutation a command, and adds capability through
  registries.
* It does not schedule volumetric data, SHELX round-trips or Rietveld.
  Those are [docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) § 12 and stay there until they are
  asked for.
