# TODO

Work that is wanted but not yet scheduled into a phase.
[docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md) holds the architecture;
[docs/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) schedules what is in here.  This file
holds everything that came up while using the application.  An entry
gets deleted when it ships, not ticked.

## Interface

### Dragging a panel has not been tried with a real mouse

The dividers were measured through `QMainWindow.resizeDocks`, which is
what a drag ends up calling, and the causes found that way are fixed:
per-panel minimums, the tab bar's width, and every dock being a native
window (`xtalapp.application.keep_siblings_non_native`).  Nothing has
driven an actual pointer, because run-app cannot without taking over
the user's.  If a drag still misbehaves -- especially one that ends
over the 3D view, which is still a native window -- that is the next
place to look.

### The net in the MOF builder cannot be turned

`NetPreview` in `xtalapp/dialogs/mof_preview.py` draws the chosen net
as a fixed orthographic projection with `QPainter`.  Recognising a
net from one angle works for `pcu` and fails for anything whose
defining feature is edge-on from that angle.  Wanted: drag to rotate,
the way the viewport does, and a reset.  It should stay a `QPainter`
widget -- the module docstring's reason for not using the viewport
still holds -- so this is a rotation matrix updated on mouse drag and
applied before the projection, not a GL context.

## Symmetry

### Merge duplicates cannot see a site duplicated by its own group

`symmetry.duplicate_groups` compares a site against *other* sites'
images and never against its own, so a site far enough off a special
position for the group to generate two of it is invisible to Merge
Duplicates at any tolerance.  Raising `p1.SPECIAL_POSITION_TOL` to
0.05 A closed this at the tolerance the dialog opens on -- the
expansion now collapses anything the default merge would have wanted
to -- but a user who drags the tolerance to 0.2 A can still be told
"no duplicates" about images 0.1 A apart.

It is a *reporting* gap rather than a merging one: merging drops whole
sites and a site's own orbit cannot be half-dropped, so the honest fix
is for the preview to say "Zn1 is 0.06 A off its mirror and the group
is making three of it" and point at Standardize, not to offer a merge
that cannot happen.  Wanted with whatever finally reports a site
sitting just off a special position, which nothing does today.

## Force fields

### UFF4MOF's O_2_z has no rule behind it

The type is in the table and is reachable only through the per-atom
override.  The obvious reading of it -- the carboxylate oxygen on a
framework metal -- was tried and measured: relaxing MOF-5 with it puts
Zn-O(carboxylate) at 1.834 A against an experimental 1.941, where
leaving those oxygens as `O_3` gives 1.891.  It makes the one number
it is supposed to fix worse, so `xtal/ff/uff/typer.py`'s `_oxygen`
deliberately does not assign it and says so.

What is wanted is the environment the 2014 paper actually fitted it
for.  Its parameters are an sp2 oxygen with `O_3_z`'s shortened radius,
which is a clue and not an answer.

### Neither tblite nor xtb gives a stress this application can use

`xtal/ff/xtb/calculator.py` sets `provides_stress = False` and pays
`numeric_stress`'s twelve evaluations a step, which is the same price
DFTB+ pays and for a better-measured reason: tblite writes a virial,
and dividing it by the cell volume disagrees with a numeric stress by
ten per cent on quartz under GFN1-xTB -- 0.874 against 0.972
kcal/mol/A^3 on the two equal diagonal components, with the numeric
one stable to four decimals from a 1e-3 strain down to 1e-5.

Ten per cent is not noise and not a sign convention.  Finding the
normalisation makes variable-cell relaxation twelve times cheaper for
both external engines.  The measurement above is the whole method:
build the engine over quartz, compare `Result.stress` against
`Calculator.numeric_stress`, and vary the strain to show which of the
two is the unreliable one.  `tests/test_xtb.py` asserts only that no
stress is claimed, which is today's behaviour and not the wanted one.

The DFTB+ panel's own variable-cell relaxation has the same gap:
DFTB+'s printed stress tensor has never been checked against a numeric
one, so the panel pays for a numeric stress.  The native driver
(*Optimise with DFTB+'s driver*) sidesteps it, because LatticeOpt uses
DFTB+'s stress inside DFTB+.

### The GFN methods are one binary each, and it is not by choice

`xtal/ff/xtb/calculator.py`'s `METHODS` routes GFN1 and GFN2 to tblite
and GFN-FF to xtb, and offers no control over it, because measurement
left nothing to choose:

| | tblite 0.3.0 | tblite 0.6.0 | xtb 6.7.1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| GFN2, periodic | works | **SIGSEGV** | refuses: "Multipoles not available with PBC" |
| GFN1, periodic | works | works | **SIGSEGV** |
| GFN-FF, periodic | — | — | works |

Both crashes are the program's and not this application's.  tblite
0.6.0 segfaults on a two-atom silicon cell as readily as on MOF-5's
424, right after printing its repulsion energy; xtb's periodic GFN1
fails to diagonalise the silicon cell and segfaults on MOF-5 *after*
reporting its own SCC converged, with or without `--grad` and with
none of our flags involved.

So GFN2 needs a tblite that works, and this application cannot tell
which one it has been pointed at short of running it.  What would help
is a cheap self-test -- a two-atom cell through the chosen binary,
once, when the path preference changes -- which is the same shape as
the Slater-Koster check DFTB+ does before it launches.

### UFF4MOF-II redefines Pt4+2 and the table does not

The machine-readable UFF4MOF table carries a second `Pt4+2` with
`r1 = 1.125` where Rappe's is 1.364, under the same name -- so it is a
replacement and not an addition, and there is no way to hold both.
`xtal/ff/uff/params.py` keeps Rappe's and skips it, because changing a
row the 1992 paper prints is a different decision from adding ninety-one
new ones, and `tests/test_uff_params.py` asserts the published value.

## Modules

### The pore surface is not a contour of anything but distance

The accessible surface ships: `xtal/analysis/grid.py` samples the
distance to the nearest atom surface over the cell and its periodic
images, `xtal/analysis/isosurface.py` marches it, and the
accessible-volume run draws the boundary of the volume it just
reported.  Two things it does not do, and neither blocks anything:

* **Pockets are drawn with the channels.**  Zeo++ splits its numbers
  into AV and NAV -- what a probe can reach from outside, and closed
  voids it cannot -- and the surface makes no such distinction, so a
  framework with sealed cavities draws them alongside its channels.
  Telling them apart means a connected-component pass over the grid
  with a union-find that carries periodic offsets, which is the same
  algorithm `CHANNEL::findChannels` is, and it would also give the
  surface a per-component colour.
* **Nothing welds the vertices.**  Marching tetrahedra emits six per
  cut cell and shares none between them, so MFU-4l's surface is
  567 000 points for 189 000 triangles.  It renders, and the mesh is
  thrown away on the next run, so this is only worth doing if the
  surface ever needs to be *written* -- an STL for a figure, or the
  project file it is deliberately kept out of.

### The .cgd writer has never met Systre

File ▸ Export Net for Systre is checked by reading the file back
through this application's own expansion, which is not an independent
check.  Run Systre on MOF-5's and rutile's exported nets once and keep
the output beside the tests.  Java 8 is installed; Systre is not.

## Testing and threads

### A finished worker thread can deadlock the application

This is an application bug that shows up as a test hang, and
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) § Testing the GUI has the diagnosis.
`xtalapp/workers.py` connects `worker.finished` to `thread.quit`;
PySide6 can free the `QThread` wrapper *inside* signal delivery while
Qt holds the connection mutex, and a thread holding the GIL that then
asks Qt to connect anything waits forever.  The same race can hang the
shipped application when a module run finishes.

Holding the pair alive from Python is the obvious remedy and is not
enough on its own: it broke `test_modules_ui` outright.  Fixing this is
also what gives back `-n auto` -- 25 s instead of about 173 s serial.
